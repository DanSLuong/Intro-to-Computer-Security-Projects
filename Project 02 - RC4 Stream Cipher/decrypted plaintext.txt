                                                     ?Ra?UD???lC4) is a sream cipher. While remarkable for is simpliciy and speed in sofware, muliple vulnerabiliies have been discovered in RC4, rendering i insecure. I is especially vulnerable when he beginning of he oupu keysream is no discarded, or when nonrandom or relaed keys are used. Paricularly problemaic uses of RC4 have led o very insecure proocols such as WEP.
